	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	Hello, my name is Amy! I first fell in love with bullet journaling in September 2018.
	It is a way to keep my life organized while also connecting my love of arts and crafts.
	I thought it would be fun to create a website that included the basics of a bullet 
	journal and make it digital.

	<h2>Bullet Journaling in a Nutshell</h2>
	<p>
	For those of you who are unfamiliar with the concept of bullet journaling, these are the
	main components that are commonly included in a bullet journal:
	<ul type="circle">
		<li>Index</li>
		<li>Year in Review/Future Planning</li>
		<li>Monthly Spreads</li>
		<li>Habit Trackers</li>
		<li>Collections</li>
		<li>Weekly Spreads</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>Index</h3>
	<p>
	The index allows you to quickly see where all your spreads are located. For this website
	the navigation bar will serve as the index.
	</p>
	<h3>Year in Review/Future Planning</h3>
	<p>
	This is where you can look at the whole year at a glance and plan for future events
	months in advance. For purposes of time, this will not be included in this site.
	</p>
	<h3>Monthly Spreads</h3>
	<p>
	Monthly spreads usually include a calendar of that month, along with any events 
	happening that month.
	</p>
	<h3>Habit Trackers</h3>
	<p>These spreads are a way of tracking any habits you would like to keep an eye on. Some examples
	include: drinking a certain amount of water, tracking what days you exercise, tracking
	the days that you study etc... Habit trackers are handy to see if you are reaching 
	goals that you have set for yourself.
	</p>
	<h3>Collections</h3>
	<p>Collection spreads are pages that allow you to track anything that isn't a habit.
	They are often a simple list like the books you've read that month/year, or the movies
	you have seen. They can also be a collection of doodles, or just simple brainstorming pages.
	</p>
	<h3>Weekly Spreads</h3>
	<p>Weekly spreads are similar to monthly spreads, except they only involve one week at 
	a time and allow you to plan more specifically. </p>

	<p>This site will serve as my own personal bullet journal - but on the web!</p>
